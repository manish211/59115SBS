# Unit tests in Python

Python has some great unit testing tools. The one
shown below is a "less-is-more" approach and is
based on [Kent Beck video on how to write a test engine in just a 
few lines of code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIonZ6-4nuU).

For example usages, see [okok.py](okok.md) which can be loaded via

```
python okok.py
```

Share and enjoy.
